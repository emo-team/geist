# Douglas M. Purdy : Godō Shintan Shakya : 悟道深潭釋迦
**A way seeking mind** : a map offered to fellow travelers of the Way.

Alexander the Great once came across some Indian sages in a meadow who were discussing philosophy. 

When these sages saw Alexander and his army, their only reaction was to stamp their feet loudly on the ground. 

When asked what they meant by this odd behavior, they replied: 

> “King Alexander, everyone can possess only so much of the earth’s surface as this we are standing on. You are human like the rest of us, except you are always busy and up to no good, traveling so many miles from your home, a nuisance to yourself and to others. Ah well! You will soon be dead, and then you will own just as much of this earth as needed to bury you.”

Dogen provided an expression of time, what is an expression of mine?

無

An experienced one, 
when deeply practicing mindfulness,
clearly saw a way of being,
relieving all suffering.

K(no)w breath,
K(no)w eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin,
K(no)w sensations,
K(no)w feelings,
K(no)w perceptions,
K(no)w objects,
K(no)w mind,
K(no)w.

With (no)thing more to attain,
an experienced one relies on this way,
completely unafraid.

Far beyond all k(no)wing, 
At last, freedom.

+= nothing to add, 
-= nothing to delete,
:= nothing is complete.

This is the treasury of the true dharma eye, the marvelous heart-mind of nirvana, the true form of the formless, and the subtle dharma gate, independent of words and transmitted beyond doctrine. This I have entrusted to you.

A few notes for duelists:

The fate of Prometheans? At first, you will laugh, then you will cry, then you will understand.

There are only three kinds of problems: problems of imagination, problems of coordination and problems of will. Dream your way out, talk your way out or work your way out. 
 (In, Out),
(Mine, Thine),
(Life, Death),
(Joy, Sorrow),
(Space, Time),
(Energy, Momentum)
(Matter, Mind),
K(no)w (Symmetric, Asymmetry).

Water is Water,
Water is not Water,
Water is both Water and not Water,
Water is neither Water nor not Water,
Are you wet yet?

There appears to be only one thing that is truly scarce in our experience: now. What you are doing right now, with who right now, thinking right now, feeling right now are the only truly valuable things in existence. Everything else, including the future or the past, appears to be a chimera - a work of art created on the canvas of now. While given this gift of now, vow to love it, all of it. Feeling the overwhelming love of now, a joyous love of now, a love so complete all fear, pain and suffering is justified throughout all of existence.
